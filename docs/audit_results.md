### Findings

#### F1.1 — "You shoot an arrow!" / "You cast a fireball!" scroll-text [INVENTED]
**Location**: `src/game/gameplay_scene.rs:762-767` (bow/wand release) and
`src/game/gameplay_scene.rs:3046-3051` (`GameAction::Shoot` menu).
**Reference**: `reference/logic/combat.md#missile_step`,
`reference/logic/dialog_system.md#hardcoded-scroll-messages--complete-reference`
(no entry for arrow/fireball fire).
**Issue**: Original `fmain.c` emits **no** scroll-area text when the hero
releases a bow or casts a wand — the only side effects are `effect()` SFX
and the projectile being placed in `missile_list[]`. These strings are not
in `faery.toml [narr]` and not in `dialog_system.md`. Violates the
two-source scroll-text rule.
**Resolution**: Both strings removed; arrow consumption preserved.

#### F1.2 — Immune target still takes pushback / follow-through [NEEDS-FIX]
**Location**: `src/game/gameplay_scene.rs` (`apply_hit`, was ~1917-1943).
**Reference**: `reference/logic/combat.md#dohit` (`fmain2.c:231-235`).
**Issue**: Reference `dohit` checks immunity (necromancer / witch /
spectre / ghost) **before** any other effect and returns immediately on a
block — no damage, no SFX, no `move_figure` knockback, no `checkdead`.
Rust set `actual_damage = 0` but then still applied target pushback,
attacker follow-through, and fell through to the `checkdead` branch.
**Resolution**: Immunity branch now bypasses the entire damage / pushback /
follow-through block. `checkdead` is skipped because vitality was never
decremented.

#### F1.3 — DRAGON / SETFIG knockback not suppressed [NEEDS-FIX]
**Location**: `src/game/gameplay_scene.rs` (`apply_hit`, pushback block).
**Reference**: `reference/logic/combat.md#dohit` / `combat.md#notes`
(`fmain2.c:243` — `type != DRAGON && type != SETFIG`).
**Issue**: Every melee hit unconditionally shoved the target 2px. Original
`dohit` gates pushback on `type != DRAGON && type != SETFIG` — dragons and
static scenario NPCs are immovable.
**Resolution**: Added `target_pushable` guard — skip pushback when
`npc.npc_type == NPC_TYPE_DRAGON` or `(npc.race & 0x80) != 0` (SETFIG bit).

#### F1.4 — Attacker follow-through not gated on target move [NEEDS-FIX]
**Location**: `src/game/gameplay_scene.rs` (`apply_hit`).
**Reference**: `reference/logic/combat.md#dohit`
(`if pushable and move_figure(j, fc, 2) and i >= 0: move_figure(i, fc, 2)`).
**Issue**: The hero's follow-through step was unconditional — even against
an immovable target (dragon, setfig, terrain-blocked) the hero would slide
forward 2px. Reference only moves the attacker when the target moved.
**Resolution**: Follow-through now gated on `target_moved` (which is set
only when pushback actually committed). `apply_hit` is never entered with
`i < 0` (arrows/fireballs are applied via the missile block), so the
`i >= 0` guard is implicit.

#### F1.5 — `brave.min(100)` cap on kill [INVENTED]
**Location**: `src/game/gameplay_scene.rs` (`apply_hit`, checkdead branch).
**Reference**: `reference/logic/combat.md#checkdead` (`fmain.c:2777`:
`brave = brave + 1` — no cap).
**Issue**: Rust capped bravery at 100 on enemy kill; reference has no upper
bound. `brave` is a `u8` in the original but reaches the 255 ceiling only
via hundreds of kills. A 100-cap breaks the melee-reach formula
`(brave/20)+5` beyond `brave=100` and the dodge curve.
**Resolution**: Removed `.min(100)`; now plain `self.state.brave += 1`.

#### F1.6 — Missing `kind -= 3` SETFIG-kill penalty [NEEDS-FIX]
**Location**: `src/game/gameplay_scene.rs` (`apply_hit`, checkdead branch).
**Reference**: `reference/logic/combat.md#checkdead`
(`fmain.c:2775`: `kind -= 3` when `type == SETFIG and race != 0x89`).
**Issue**: Killing setfigure NPCs (race bit 7 set) is supposed to impose a
3-point kindness penalty, except the witch (race `0x89`). Rust did
nothing. Affects the `kind` stat that drives end-game scoring and
brother-succession side effects.
**Resolution**: Added branch: `if (race & 0x80) != 0 && race != RACE_WITCH`
→ `self.state.kind -= 3`. Floor-at-zero clamp added per
`fmain.c:2778` (`if kind < 0: kind = 0`).

#### F1.7 — Missing dark-knight death speech `speak(42)` [NEEDS-FIX]
**Location**: `src/game/gameplay_scene.rs` (`apply_hit`, checkdead branch).
**Reference**: `reference/logic/combat.md#checkdead` (`fmain.c:2774`).
**Issue**: When a `race == 7` (dark knight / dreamknight) NPC dies, the
original emits `speak(42)` ("`dreamknight msg 2 (earned the right)`" in
`faery.toml`). Rust never fired the speech.
**Resolution**: Added `const RACE_DARK_KNIGHT: u8 = 7` (inline, local to
the branch) and `dark_knight_speech` deferred message variable. Speech is
sourced from `faery.toml [narr].speeches[42]` via `events::speak`.

#### F1.8 — Missile never expires after 40 ticks [NEEDS-FIX]
**Location**: `src/game/combat.rs` (`Missile` struct);
`src/game/gameplay_scene.rs` (missile tick block, was ~5085-5091).
**Reference**: `reference/logic/combat.md#missile_step` (`fmain.c:2274`:
`ms.time_of_flight > 40` → deactivate).
**Issue**: Rust missiles only deactivated on hit or on going out of world
bounds (`> 32768`). Fireballs fired in open terrain would fly indefinitely.
**Resolution**: Added `Missile.time_of_flight: u8` field (defaulted to 0 in
every literal and in `fire_missile`). Missile tick increments each frame
and deactivates when `time_of_flight > 40`.

#### F1.9 — `GameAction::Attack` menu-path invented scroll text [INVENTED]
**Location**: `src/game/gameplay_scene.rs` (old ~2963-2998).
**Reference**: `reference/logic/dialog_system.md` — none of `"Enemy
defeated!"`, `"You hit for {N}!"`, `"Nothing to attack."`, `"{N} items
dropped!"`, or `"The turtle rewards you with a Sea Shell!"` exist.
**Issue**: A legacy menu "Attack" command (pre-dates the proper fight
state machine) uses the deprecated `resolve_combat` helper with an
invented damage formula and invented scroll-area strings.
**Resolution**: Stripped all invented scroll messages from this path. The
underlying deprecated `resolve_combat` helper is retained and continues to
be called (to preserve any side-effects hooked into it), but the user-
visible strings are gone. The damage formula itself (`resolve_combat`) is
flagged SPEC-GAP F1.15 below — real combat runs through `run_combat_tick`
so the legacy path is dormant in normal play.

#### F1.10 — Witch lasso / necromancer talisman drops [CONFORMANT]
**Location**: `src/game/gameplay_scene.rs` (`apply_hit`, checkdead branch).
**Reference**: `reference/RESEARCH.md §7.8 "Special Death Drops"`;
`reference/logic/combat.md#notes` ("Race-specific loot drops").
**Issue**: None. The necromancer→woodcutter transform + talisman drop
(object 139) and the witch's golden-lasso drop (object 27, +10 y offset)
match spec.

#### F1.11 — Weapon-code immunity table [CONFORMANT]
**Location**: `src/game/combat.rs` `check_immunity`.
**Reference**: `reference/logic/combat.md#dohit` (`fmain2.c:231-234`),
`RESEARCH.md §7.1` immunity table.
**Issue**: None. Necromancer (race 9) → `speak(58)` if `weapon<4`; witch
(race `0x89`) → `speak(58)` if `weapon<4 && !has_sun_stone`; spectre
(`0x8a`) / ghost (`0x8b`) → silent; all others vulnerable.

#### F1.12 — Hero reach formula `(brave/20)+5`, enemy reach `2+rand4()` [CONFORMANT]
**Location**: `src/game/combat.rs` `combat_reach`.
**Reference**: `reference/logic/combat.md#melee_swing` (`fmain.c:2249-2250`);
`RESEARCH.md §7.2`.
**Issue**: None. Hero: `(brave/20)+5` clamped `[4..15]`; enemy: `2 + rand4()`
clamped at 15.

#### F1.13 — Monster dodge gate `rand256() > brave` [CONFORMANT]
**Location**: `src/game/gameplay_scene.rs` (`run_combat_tick`).
**Reference**: `reference/logic/combat.md#melee_swing` (`fmain.c:2260`).
**Issue**: None. Hero auto-hits; monsters gated by `rand256() > brave`.

#### F1.14 — Missile damage `rand8() + 4` and radii 6/9 [CONFORMANT]
**Location**: `src/game/combat.rs` `Missile::damage`, `Missile::tick`.
**Reference**: `reference/logic/combat.md#missile_step` (`fmain.c:2295-2296`);
`RESEARCH.md §7.3`.
**Issue**: None. Arrow radius 6px, fireball 9px, both damage `rand8()+4`
(4–11).

#### F1.15 — Deprecated `resolve_combat()` formula unreachable on real path [SPEC-GAP]
**Location**: `src/game/combat.rs:134-160` (`resolve_combat`,
`#[deprecated]`).
**Reference**: No matching formula in `combat.md` or `RESEARCH.md`. The
original has no "hero damage = vitality * weapon / 8" rule.
**Issue**: `resolve_combat` is a legacy pre-state-machine combat helper
with a clearly invented damage formula. It is `#[deprecated]` and is now
only reachable through the dormant `GameAction::Attack` menu path (F1.9).
**Resolution**: Queued — proposed SPEC update: explicitly document that
the real combat path is the `run_combat_tick` / `apply_hit` pair (melee
state machine) and that `resolve_combat` is deprecated pending full
removal. No fix applied in this pass because the function is behind
`#[deprecated]` and is not on a live gameplay path.

#### F1.16 — Missile terrain-stop (`px_to_im` codes 1, 15) not implemented [SPEC-GAP]
**Location**: `src/game/gameplay_scene.rs` missile tick (~5085).
**Reference**: `reference/logic/combat.md#missile_step`
(`fmain.c:2276-2277`: missile dies in place if terrain code is 1 or 15).
**Issue**: Rust missiles pass through trees, rock walls, buildings. They
only stop on hit or at world bounds. This is a fidelity gap.
**Resolution**: Queued — requires a `px_to_im`-equivalent terrain probe
wired into the missile loop. Proposed SPEC addition: missile vs. terrain
interaction (codes 1 = impassable, 15 = solid → missile dies in place,
fireball plays spent-puff frame (type=3)).

#### F1.17 — Near-miss "clang" SFX `effect(1, 150 + rand256())` not implemented [SPEC-GAP]
**Location**: `src/game/gameplay_scene.rs` (`run_combat_tick`, target-scan
loop).
**Reference**: `reference/logic/combat.md#melee_swing`
(`fmain.c:2262`: `if yd < bv + 2 and wt != 5: effect(1, 150+rand256())`).
**Issue**: No SFX on near-miss band. Also, `dohit` hit-SFX (`effect(0/2/3/5,
…)`) are not wired up. The broader `effect()` hook (`audio::play_sfx`) is
defined but not invoked from combat at all.
**Resolution**: Queued — SFX subsystem is stubbed; will be covered once
the audio subsystem audit picks up the `effect()` dispatch table. For now,
flagged as a gap rather than a bug because no SFX is emitted for any
combat event, not just near-misses.

#### F1.18 — Missile slot-0 dodge asymmetry `bitrand(512) > bv` [SPEC-GAP]
**Location**: `src/game/gameplay_scene.rs` missile tick.
**Reference**: `reference/logic/combat.md#missile_step` and
`reference/PROBLEMS.md#p16` (resolved: intentional original design —
only slot 0 missiles are dodge-eligible, giving ~17% dodge rate via
round-robin `mdex`).
**Issue**: Rust applies **no** dodge roll — every in-range missile hits.
This drops the hero's bravery-dependent projectile survivability.
**Resolution**: Queued — fix deferred because the Rust missile array is
assigned by lowest-free-slot (`fire_missile` in `combat.rs`), not by
round-robin `mdex`. Reproducing the ~17% dodge rate requires either
switching to round-robin slot assignment or adopting a different dodge
probability model. Proposed SPEC clarification needed before the fix.

#### F1.19 — `aftermath()` function not implemented [RESEARCH-REQUIRED]
**Location**: No matching function in Rust.
**Reference**: `reference/logic/combat.md#aftermath`
(`fmain2.c:253-276`); `reference/logic/dialog_system.md` lines 212-221
for the hardcoded strings `"Bravely done!"`, `"{N} foes were defeated in
battle."`, `"{N} foes fled in retreat."`.
**Issue**: Reference fires `aftermath()` when `battleflag` transitions
True→False (inside `no_motion_tick`). It tallies dead/fleeing enemies
(slot index ≥ 3, `ENEMY` type), prints the commendation line if
`vitality<5 && dead>0`, prints count lines if `xtype<50`, and triggers
`get_turtle()` if a turtle-egg delivery is pending. Rust has no
equivalent — battles end silently.
**Resolution**: Queued for user review. The three scroll strings are
already whitelisted as hardcoded literals in `dialog_system.md`; adding
`aftermath()` requires (a) threading `battleflag` edge-detection through
`no_motion_tick`, (b) adopting the per-tick `ENEMY`-filtered tally, and
(c) wiring `get_turtle()`. Left as a standalone follow-up because it
interacts with the `battleflag` detector (which itself is only an
approximation: `proximity < 300px` rather than the original
`anim_list`-based active-fighting set).

### SPEC/REQ updates queued

- **F1.15 (SPEC-GAP)**: Document the real combat path (`run_combat_tick` /
  `apply_hit`) as canonical in `SPECIFICATION.md §10 Combat`. Mark
  `combat::resolve_combat` for removal.
- **F1.16 (SPEC-GAP)**: Add missile-terrain-stop rule — `px_to_im ∈ {1,15}`
  kills the missile; fireball transitions to spent-puff frame (`missile_type
  = 3`).
- **F1.17 (SPEC-GAP)**: Document combat SFX dispatch: `effect(0, 800 +
  bitrand(511))` hero-takes-melee; `effect(1, 150+rand256())` near-miss
  clang; `effect(2, 500+rand(0,63))` arrow-hit; `effect(3, 400+rand(0,255))`
  monster-hit; `effect(5, 3200+bitrand(511))` fireball — once the audio
  subsystem is formalised.
- **F1.18 (SPEC-GAP)**: Decide whether to reproduce the
  `bitrand(512) > bv` slot-0-only dodge asymmetry via round-robin `mdex`
  or to adopt a unified per-missile dodge probability.
- **F1.19 (RESEARCH-REQUIRED)**: Add `aftermath()` to spec with exact
  transition semantics for `battleflag` edge detection.

### Blockers

None — all NEEDS-FIX and INVENTED items are resolved; SPEC-GAPs are queued
for later batch updates; the RESEARCH-REQUIRED item (F1.19 `aftermath()`)
does not block other subsystem audits.

## Subsystem 2: magic — ✅ Complete

**Reference**: `reference/logic/magic.md` (+ `messages.md` event 21 / event 34
/ speech 59, `dialog_system.md` line 339 `"That feels a lot better!"`,
`combat.md#checkdead` for the Jade Skull brave accounting).
**Code**: `src/game/magic.rs`, `try_cast_spell` + `GameAction::CastSpell1..7`
dispatch in `src/game/gameplay_scene.rs` (~645, ~3037).
**Audit date**: 2025 (current session)

### Summary
- **10 findings**: 1 CONFORMANT, 3 NEEDS-FIX (all fixed), 1 INVENTED
  (resolved — spans seven invented scroll-text strings consolidated into one
  finding), 3 SPEC-GAP (queued), 0 REF-AMBIGUOUS, 2 RESEARCH-REQUIRED
  (queued; both cosmetic rendering).
- Fixes applied in **one commit** (`13100609`).
- Build/tests: ✅ `cargo build` clean (no new warnings); `cargo test` —
  567 + 12 + 12 tests passing (+4 new magic tests).

### Findings

#### F2.1 — Invented scroll-text for every spell outcome [INVENTED]
**Location**: `src/game/magic.rs:79-153` (old `use_magic`).
**Reference**: `reference/logic/magic.md#magic_dispatch` (`fmain.c:3300-3365`);
`reference/logic/dialog_system.md` (no entries for any of the strings below).
**Issue**: `use_magic` returned `Result<&'static str, &'static str>`, and
every branch fabricated a player-facing line. None of these come from
`faery.toml [narr]` or `dialog_system.md`'s hardcoded-literal list:
- `"You have none of that."` (should be `event(21)`)
- `"Not a magic item"` (unreachable in ref)
- `"You must stand on a stone ring to use this."` (ref is silent)
- `"Move to the center of the stone ring."` (ref is silent)
- `"The stone ring transports you!"` (ref is silent)
- `"The stone ring glows but nothing happens here."` (ref is silent)
- `"A warm light surrounds you."` (Green Jewel — ref is silent)
- `"You feel unseen."` (Crystal Orb — ref is silent)
- `"The bird totem does not work indoors."` (ref is silent)
- `"The bird totem shows the way."` (ref is silent)
- `"You cannot use the ring while riding."` (ref is silent)
- `"Time slows around you."` (Gold Ring — ref is silent)
- `"Death takes them all!"` / `"No enemies to claim."` (Jade Skull — ref:
  `event(34)` only on `battleflag`)
- `"That feels a lot better!"` emitted **unconditionally** after heal
  (ref: only in the non-capped branch at `fmain.c:3352`)

Violates the two-source scroll-text rule (SPEC §23.6, REQ R-INTRO-012).
**Resolution**: Replaced `use_magic`'s `Result<&str, &str>` with a
structured `MagicResult` enum (`NoOwned` / `Suppressed` / `Applied` /
`Healed { capped }` / `StoneTeleport { capped }` /
`MassKill { slain, in_battle }`) that carries **no** prose. Caller
`try_cast_spell` in `gameplay_scene.rs` now emits:
- `event_msg(21)` on `NoOwned` (ref `fmain.c:3303`);
- silent on `Suppressed` (ref silent return, charge preserved);
- silent on `Applied` (ref silent);
- `"That feels a lot better!"` (dialog_system.md:339 literal) only when
  `capped == false`, per `fmain.c:3352`;
- `event_msg(34)` only when Jade Skull kills with `battleflag == true`.

#### F2.2 — Blue Stone missing fall-through heal [NEEDS-FIX]
**Location**: `src/game/magic.rs:80-105` (old stone-ring branch).
**Reference**: `reference/logic/magic.md#magic_dispatch` notes
("Blue Stone fall-through") — `fmain.c:3326` `case 5:` has no `break;`
before `case 7:` at `fmain.c:3348`, so every successful teleport **also**
runs `vitality += rand8() + 4` clamped at `15 + brave/4`. Confirmed in
[RESEARCH §10](../reference/RESEARCH.md#10-inventory--items).
**Issue**: Rust teleported but never healed. Players lost the intended
free Glass Vial effect on every stone-circle use.
**Resolution**: Extracted the Glass Vial heal into a shared
`apply_vial_heal(state) -> bool` helper (returns `capped`); both the
stone-ring branch and the vial branch call it. Stone ring now returns
`MagicResult::StoneTeleport { capped }` and `try_cast_spell` emits the
heal message when `!capped` — mirroring the original C fall-through.
Added `test_stone_ring_falls_through_to_heal`.

#### F2.3 — Heal message printed even when vitality was capped [NEEDS-FIX]
**Location**: `src/game/magic.rs` Glass Vial branch (old ~110-116).
**Reference**: `reference/logic/magic.md#magic_dispatch` (`fmain.c:3350-3352`):
```
if vitality > cap:
    vitality = cap
else:
    print("That feels a lot better!")   # fmain.c:3352 — only in non-capped branch
```
**Issue**: Rust pushed the message on every successful heal, including
when the rolled heal overshot the cap and was clamped. Ref only prints
when there was room to heal.
**Resolution**: `apply_vial_heal` returns a `capped` flag; caller only
emits the string when `!capped`. Added `test_vial_heal_capped_flag`.

#### F2.4 — Jade Skull net-brave decrement is a fidelity bug [NEEDS-FIX]
**Location**: `src/game/magic.rs` Jade Skull branch (old ~151).
**Reference**: `reference/logic/magic.md#magic_dispatch`
(`fmain.c:3357-3359`) and `reference/logic/combat.md#checkdead`
(`fmain.c:2777` — `brave += 1` on every `i != 0` kill).
**Issue**: Ref loop body is
```
an.vitality = 0
checkdead(i, 0)      # brave += 1 (i != 0 branch)
brave = brave - 1    # explicit magic-dispatch penalty
```
Net effect: **`brave` unchanged per kill** (the +1 and −1 cancel). Rust
only did the `-1` and never called `checkdead`, producing a net −N on
N kills — a hidden cowardice penalty nowhere in the original.
**Resolution**: Removed the `state.brave -= killed` line. Net brave is
now 0 per kill, matching the ref. Updated
`test_jade_skull_no_brave_change` (formerly asserted −3; now asserts
no change) and added `test_jade_skull_battleflag_reported`,
`test_jade_skull_skips_race_7_plus`. The full `checkdead`
STATE_DYING / loot drop consequence for Jade Skull kills is flagged
below as F2.8 SPEC-GAP — the brave arithmetic is now correct, but the
death-transition plumbing (drops, `STATE_DYING`, `actor_tick` death
step) is still missing.

#### F2.5 — `event(21)` / `event(34)` / `speak(59)` ordering [NEEDS-FIX]
**Location**: `src/game/gameplay_scene.rs` `try_cast_spell` (was ~645-668).
**Reference**: `reference/logic/magic.md#magic_dispatch`
(`fmain.c:3303-3304`): not-owned check **precedes** the `extn.v3 == 9`
arena gate.
**Issue**: Old Rust checked the arena first (`speak(59)`) and only
called `use_magic` when outside the arena; inside the arena, an
attempt to cast an unowned spell would fire `speak(59)` instead of
`event(21)`. Additionally, `event(21)` and `event(34)` were not wired
at all — the NoOwned path used an invented string (F2.1) and the mass-
kill path never fired `event(34)` regardless of `battleflag`.
**Resolution**: Reordered: (1) not-owned ⇒ `event(21)`, (2) arena ⇒
`speak(59)`, (3) `use_magic` dispatch. `event(34)` now fires from the
`MassKill { in_battle: true, .. }` arm via
`events::event_msg(narr, 34, bname)`. All three strings resolve via
`faery.toml [narr].event_msg` / `[narr].speeches`.

#### F2.6 — `extn.v3 == 9` gate lives in caller, not magic_dispatch [CONFORMANT]
**Location**: `src/game/gameplay_scene.rs:650-660` (`try_cast_spell`
arena check) vs `src/game/magic.rs`.
**Reference**: `reference/logic/magic.md#magic_dispatch` (`fmain.c:3304`
— `if extn.v3 == 9: speak(59); return`).
**Issue**: The gate is inside `magic_dispatch` in the original but is
split into `try_cast_spell` in Rust because the extent lookup needs
zone data that lives on `GameplayScene`, not `GameState`. Behavior is
equivalent: identical `speak(59)` emission, identical no-consume
semantics, and the ordering relative to the not-owned check now
matches the ref (see F2.5).

#### F2.7 — Magic Wand fireball dispatches through combat `missile_step` [CONFORMANT]
**Location**: `src/game/gameplay_scene.rs:3058-3083`
(`GameAction::Shoot`); `src/game/combat.rs` `fire_missile`.
**Reference**: `reference/logic/magic.md` Notes ("Magic Wand vs the
Necromancer/Witch", `fmain.c:1693`); `reference/logic/combat.md#missile_step`.
**Issue**: None. Wand `weapon == 5` fires a fireball missile (mt=9) at
no ammo cost — Rust's `Shoot` branch only decrements `stuff[8]` when
`weapon == 4` (bow). `stuff[4]` is treated as a binary equip flag and
is never decremented per shot. Immunity bypass (`weapon >= 4` for
necromancer, `weapon >= 4 && stuff[7] != 0` for masked witch) already
covered in Subsystem 1 F1.11.

#### F2.8 — Jade Skull skips STATE_DYING / loot / race-drop pipeline [SPEC-GAP]
**Location**: `src/game/magic.rs` Jade Skull branch.
**Reference**: `reference/logic/magic.md#magic_dispatch`
(`fmain.c:3359` `checkdead(i, 0)`); `reference/logic/combat.md#checkdead`;
`reference/logic/combat.md` Notes on race-specific drops (emitted in
`actor_tick` STATE_DYING branch).
**Issue**: Ref Jade Skull routes each kill through `checkdead`, which
transitions the actor to `STATE_DYING` with `tactic = 7`; the
subsequent `actor_tick` frames then run race-specific loot drops and
the dying-animation countdown. Rust Jade Skull only sets `vitality = 0`
on the matching actors. No loot rolls fire, no dying animation plays,
and the actors sit inert. Since the `race < 7` filter excludes
Necromancer (9), masked Witch (`0x89`), Spectre (`0x8a`), and all
SETFIGs, this is purely about standard-enemy loot / death animation
— not about quest-critical drops.
**Resolution**: Queued — requires either (a) extracting Rust's
apply_hit death-transition block into a shared helper callable from
`magic::use_magic`, or (b) relocating Jade Skull's per-actor kill into
`try_cast_spell` where the loot + death-transition machinery is
already available. Proposed SPEC addition: explicitly document that
Jade Skull routes each kill through the same `checkdead` / death-
transition pipeline as a melee kill, including `loot::roll_treasure`
and the STATE_DYING → STATE_DEAD animation countdown.

#### F2.9 — `colorplay()` 32-frame palette strobe on stone-ring teleport [SPEC-GAP]
**Location**: `src/game/magic.rs` stone-ring branch.
**Reference**: `reference/logic/magic.md#magic_dispatch`
(`fmain.c:3336`: `colorplay()` — 32-frame palette strobe before `xfer`).
**Issue**: Rust teleports instantly with no palette cue. Not a gameplay
bug but a visible-feedback fidelity loss.
**Resolution**: Queued. Proposed SPEC addition under §19.2: stone-ring
teleport must run a 32-frame palette strobe (documented in
`reference/logic/visual-effects.md`) before changing `hero_x/y`.

#### F2.10 — Bird Totem "+" marker not rendered on map bitmap [RESEARCH-REQUIRED]
**Location**: `src/game/magic.rs` totem branch (`state.viewstatus = 1`).
**Reference**: `reference/logic/magic.md#magic_dispatch`
(`fmain.c:3311-3325`): `bigdraw` blits the world map, then the block
computes hero pixel coords `(i, j)` and draws `"+"` at palette pen 31
with `JAM1` draw-mode; clips to `0 < i < 320` and `0 < j < 143`.
**Issue**: Rust only sets `viewstatus = 1`. The map overlay path has
to be wired to the actual map-bitmap surface and a `"+"` glyph plotted
at the hero's scaled position. No corresponding Rust rendering code
exists yet.
**Resolution**: Queued for user review. The marker geometry
(`(hero_x >> 4) - ((secx + xreg) << 4) - 4`, pen 31, `JAM1`) is well-
specified in ref; implementation requires map-overlay hooks that are
not yet present in `src/scenes/map_scene.rs` (or wherever map
rendering lives).

### SPEC/REQ updates queued

- **F2.8 (SPEC-GAP)**: `SPECIFICATION.md §19.2` should state that Jade
  Skull routes each killed actor through the standard `checkdead` /
  STATE_DYING pipeline — including `loot::roll_treasure` and the
  dying-animation countdown — not just `vitality = 0`.
- **F2.9 (SPEC-GAP)**: `SPECIFICATION.md §19.2` should add a
  "32-frame palette strobe (`colorplay()`) runs immediately before the
  teleport" note for the Blue Stone branch.
- **F2.10 (RESEARCH-REQUIRED)**: Add Bird Totem map-overlay "+" marker
  rendering requirement with the exact geometry and pen index (31,
  JAM1) once the map-overlay rendering path is formalised.

### Blockers

None — all NEEDS-FIX and INVENTED items are resolved; SPEC-GAPs and the
single RESEARCH-REQUIRED item (F2.10, cosmetic map marker) are queued
for later batch updates and do not block other subsystem audits.

## Subsystem 3: ai-system — ✅ Complete

**Reference**: `reference/logic/ai-system.md` (+ `game-loop.md §actor_tick`,
`RESEARCH.md §8`, `frustration.md`, `SYMBOLS.md §GOAL_*`/`TACTIC_*`/`STATE_*`)
**Code**: `src/game/npc_ai.rs` (`tick_npc`, `select_tactic`, `do_tactic`),
AI wiring in `src/game/gameplay_scene.rs::update_actors`,
frust-latching in `src/game/npc.rs::tick_with_actors`
**Audit date**: 2025 (current session)

### Summary

  `cargo test` — 576 + 12 + 12 tests passing (8 new targeted tests added).

### Findings

#### F3.1 — SETFIG actors re-aim at hero every tick [INVENTED]
**Location**: `src/game/npc_ai.rs::tick_npc` (SETFIG early-return block).
**Reference**: `reference/logic/ai-system.md:46`
(`if actor.type == SETFIG: return` — `fmain.c:2119-2120`).
**Issue**: Rust's SETFIG branch short-circuited the AI loop but kept a
special case that called `set_course(SC_AIM)` + `state = Still` whenever the
actor's goal was `Goal::Stand`, re-orienting shopkeepers toward the hero on
every tick. Original `advance_goal` exits **immediately** for SETFIG — no
goal/state/facing/tactic mutations at all. Shopkeeper pose comes from
`set_shape` at spawn time, not from per-tick AI.
**Resolution**: SETFIG branch now returns unconditionally. Two tests that
enforced the invented behavior (`test_setfig_shopkeeper_stand_faces_hero`
and `test_freeze_nonhostile_npc_still_acts`) were rewritten to assert that
the spawn-time pose is preserved verbatim.

#### F3.2 — Melee-reach threshold used wrong numeric GOAL values [NEEDS-FIX]
**Location**: `src/game/npc_ai.rs::goal_value` (renamed `goal_numeric`).
**Reference**: `reference/logic/ai-system.md:103` (`thresh = 14 - mode`),
`SYMBOLS.md:275-286` (`GOAL_ATTACK1=1, ATTACK2=2, ARCHER1=3, ARCHER2=4`).
**Issue**: The helper mapped `Attack1 → 0, Attack2 → 1, Archer1 → 3,
Archer2 → 4`, producing `thresh = 14, 13, 11, 10` instead of the ref's
`13, 12, 11, 10`. ATTACK1 and ATTACK2 enemies therefore engaged melee at
1-pixel longer reach than the original.
**Resolution**: Renamed helper to `goal_numeric` with correct numeric
values for all GOAL_* constants. Added `test_melee_thresh_uses_numeric_goal`
verifying ATTACK1 engages at xd=12, ATTACK2 does not.

#### F3.3 — Snakes unconditionally march to fixed turtle-nest coords [INVENTED]
**Location**: `src/game/npc_ai.rs::select_tactic` (snake branch).
**Reference**: `reference/logic/ai-system.md:84`
(`if actor.race == 4 and turtle_eggs: tactic = EGG_SEEK`).
**Issue**: Rust unconditionally set `Tactic::EggSeek` for any snake
(`race == 4`), making snakes teleport-seek `(23087, 5667)` in every zone
whether or not the global `turtle_eggs` counter was non-zero. Original
gates EGG_SEEK on that counter; when zero, snakes fall through to the
normal armed/unarmed/vitality/range decision tree and pursue the hero.
**Resolution**: `tick_npc` / `select_tactic` now take a `turtle_eggs: bool`
parameter. `gameplay_scene::update_actors` passes `false` today
(SPEC-GAP — the `turtle_eggs` global is not yet plumbed into `GameState`;
see F3.10). Added `test_snake_no_egg_seek_when_eggs_absent` and
`test_snake_egg_seek_when_eggs_present`.

#### F3.4 — Dark knight `stand_guard` outside melee reach missing [NEEDS-FIX]
**Location**: `src/game/npc_ai.rs::select_tactic` (post melee-shortcut).
**Reference**: `reference/logic/ai-system.md:110-112`
(`elif actor.race == 7 and actor.vitality != 0: stand_guard` —
`fmain.c:2168-2169`), `RESEARCH.md §Dark Knight`.
**Issue**: When a living DKnight (`race == 7`) was outside his extended
16-pixel reach, Rust fell through to the normal tactic tree (Pursue /
Evade / Backup). Original ref forces `state = STILL, facing = DIR_S` —
the DKnight plants himself and waits. Combined with his fixed spawn
position (21635, 25762), this is the behavior that keeps him blocking the
hidden valley exit.
**Resolution**: Added the `race == 7 && vitality > 0` stand_guard branch
after the close-range melee shortcut. Added
`test_dknight_stand_guard_out_of_reach` and
`test_dknight_stand_guard_only_when_alive`.

#### F3.5 — `Tactic::Frust` was a no-op — frust-latched NPCs stuck [NEEDS-FIX]
**Location**: `src/game/npc_ai.rs` — `do_tactic` (treated Frust as no-op);
Frust is latched by `npc.rs::tick_with_actors` on full-block.
**Reference**: `reference/logic/ai-system.md:70-75`
(`if tactic == FRUST or tactic == SHOOTFRUST: do_tactic(rand(…))`),
`frustration.md#resolve_frust_tactic` (`fmain.c:2141-2144`).
**Issue**: Blocked NPCs set `tactic = Frust` to request a new tactic next
tick, but `do_tactic` had a match arm that did nothing for Frust, and
`select_tactic` never checked for it — so frust-latched actors never
recovered, effectively freezing any NPC that collided with scenery.
**Resolution**: `select_tactic` now detects `Tactic::Frust` before the
goal-mode branches and assigns a random fallback tactic:
bow actors (`weapon & 4 != 0`) draw from `rand(2,5)` →
`Follow/BumbleSeek/Random/Backup`; melee actors draw from `rand(3,4)` →
`BumbleSeek/Random`. The rest of the pipeline then executes the new
tactic normally. Added `test_frust_tactic_dispatches_random_fallback`
and `test_frust_tactic_dispatches_bow_fallback`.

#### F3.6 — `do_tactic` rate-limit mis-gated (ARCHER2 + SHOOT) [NEEDS-FIX]
**Location**: `src/game/npc_ai.rs::do_tactic` (opening probabilistic gate).
**Reference**: `RESEARCH.md §8.2` (fmain2.c:1666-1682 —
`r = !(rand() & 7)`; `if goal == ATTACK2: r = !(rand() & 3)`; SHOOT
bypasses the gate entirely).
**Issue**: Rust gated the tactic executor at 25% for both `Attack2` and
`Archer2`; original upgrades only `ATTACK2`. More importantly, `SHOOT`
must **not** be rate-limited (archers need to face the hero every tick
to line up their shot), but Rust passed SHOOT through the gate, throttling
archer firing facing updates.
**Resolution**: Gate now uses `goal == Attack2 → 3, else → 7`; and
`Tactic::Shoot` bypasses the gate entirely. Added
`test_do_tactic_shoot_bypasses_rate_limit`.

#### F3.7 — Hero-dead leader/follower split wrong [NEEDS-FIX]
**Location**: `src/game/npc_ai.rs::select_tactic` (hero_dead override),
`src/game/gameplay_scene.rs::update_actors` (caller).
**Reference**: `reference/logic/ai-system.md:60-64` + line 555
(`leader = 0` at loop start; `if (leader == 0) leader = i` at
`fmain.c:2183`).
**Issue**: Rust set `goal = Follower` for any NPC whenever *some* leader
slot existed (`leader_idx.is_some()`). That makes the leader itself also
assign Follower to itself, so nobody flees first. Original ref zeroes
`leader` at loop start; the **first** iterated eligible actor sees
`leader == 0` → `GOAL_FLEE`, and subsequent iterations see `leader != 0`
→ `GOAL_FOLLOWER`.
**Resolution**: `tick_npc`/`select_tactic` now take the actor's own
`npc_idx`. `hero_dead` path: `leader_idx == Some(npc_idx) || None → Flee;
otherwise → Follower`. Added
`test_hero_dead_leader_flees_others_follow`.

#### F3.8 — Melee-weapon test used `weapon < 4` instead of bit test [NEEDS-FIX]
**Location**: `src/game/npc_ai.rs::select_tactic` (close-range melee check).
**Reference**: `reference/logic/ai-system.md:105`
(`if (actor.weapon & 4) == 0`).
**Issue**: Rust used `weapon < 4` to detect melee. Equivalent for the
weapon values 0–7 actually in use, but it encoded an invariant (`weapon
never ≥ 8`) the ref never made. Bit-2 test is the canonical check.
**Resolution**: Changed to `(weapon & 4) == 0`.

#### F3.9 — `Goal::Stand` used SC_AIM; ref uses SC_SMART + stop_motion [NEEDS-FIX]
**Location**: `src/game/npc_ai.rs::select_tactic` Stand branch.
**Reference**: `reference/logic/ai-system.md:121-122`
(`set_course(actor, hero_x, hero_y, 0)` then `stop_motion(actor)`).
**Issue**: Rust called `set_course(SC_AIM)` (mode 5) which skips the
axis-suppression applied by mode 0 (smart seek). On diagonals this
produced slightly different facings for Stand-goal actors vs the original
(facing toward the hero without axis snap).
**Resolution**: Stand branch now calls `set_course(SC_SMART)` (mode 0)
and then overrides `state = Still` to match `stop_motion`.

#### F3.10 — `xtype > 59` race filter uses `race < 4` placeholder [SPEC-GAP]
**Location**: `src/game/npc_ai.rs::select_tactic`.
**Reference**: `reference/logic/ai-system.md:65`
(`xtype > 59 and actor.race != extn.v3`), `RESEARCH.md:1483`.
**Issue**: The fidelity-exact condition needs the currently-active extent
record (`extn.v3` = per-zone race filter, e.g. 7 for DKnight valley,
9 for necromancer arena). That pointer is not plumbed into GameState
yet, so Rust keeps a hand-tuned placeholder `race < 4`. For DKnight
(race 7, v3 7) both conditions agree, so no current zone misbehaves —
but a future port of spectre / witch special zones will need the real
`extn.v3`.
**Resolution**: Queued. SPEC §11 should add an `extn.v3` field to the
zone/extent model and `select_tactic` should consult it directly.

#### F3.11 — `turtle_eggs` global counter not plumbed [SPEC-GAP]
**Location**: `src/game/game_state.rs` (`try_rescue_egg` stub),
`src/game/gameplay_scene.rs::update_actors` (hardcodes `turtle_eggs = false`).
**Reference**: `reference/logic/ai-system.md:84` and surrounding
turtle-egg quest at `fmain.c:3040-3100`.
**Issue**: The original `turtle_eggs` world-state counter is replaced by
an inventory-item stub in `GameState`. Snakes can never enter EGG_SEEK
until the counter is formalised.
**Resolution**: Queued. Once the turtle-eggs counter is modelled as a
world flag (not inventory), thread it through `update_actors` into
`tick_npc`.

#### F3.12 — `STATE_SHOOT1` → `fire_aimed_shot` branch missing [SPEC-GAP]
**Location**: `src/game/npc_ai.rs::select_tactic` (no SHOOT1 short-circuit),
`src/game/gameplay_scene.rs::update_actors` (uses `archer_cooldown`).
**Reference**: `reference/logic/ai-system.md:54-56` (`elif actor.state ==
STATE_SHOOT1: fire_aimed_shot`).
**Issue**: The ref uses a two-frame archer state machine
(SHOOT1 = aiming, SHOOT3 = fired). Rust short-circuits with a single
`archer_cooldown` counter driven off the per-NPC `Shooting` state. Same
observable firing behaviour, but the FSM topology and cadence differ.
**Resolution**: Queued. Proper fidelity requires introducing
SHOOT1/SHOOT3 states and wiring `fire_aimed_shot` to the SHOOT1→SHOOT3
transition.

#### F3.13 — Carrier (daynight & 15) == 0 cadence missing [SPEC-GAP]
**Location**: `src/game/npc_ai.rs::tick_npc` (carriers route to a
different code path), `src/game/gameplay_scene.rs` (turtle auto).
**Reference**: `reference/logic/ai-system.md` carrier preamble
(`fmain.c:2114-2117`).
**Issue**: Original `advance_goal` for carrier-type actors only calls
`set_course(…, mode=5)` every 16 ticks (`daynight & 15 == 0`). Rust
handles turtle carriers through a dedicated T3-CARRY-TURTLE-AUTO path
that ignores this cadence.
**Resolution**: Queued for the carrier-transport subsystem audit.

#### F3.14 — `frustflag` reset semantics differ from ref [SPEC-GAP]
**Location**: `src/game/gameplay_scene.rs::update_player_motion`.
**Reference**: `reference/logic/frustration.md` (ref resets frustflag
from any successful actor action — SINK, walk, shot, melee, dying —
at `fmain.c:1577, 1650, 1707, 1715, 1725`).
**Issue**: Rust only resets `frustflag` when the player walks or when
*any* enemy NPC is active. The per-actor successful-action resets are
not wired, so the frustration animation can trigger during combat even
when NPCs are acting.
**Resolution**: Queued for subsystem 20 (frustration) audit — cross-
cutting change touching walk_step, shoot, melee, and checkdead paths.

### CONFORMANT items

- **C3.1 — Battleflag 300-pixel proximity test**: Rust's
  `update_actors` sets `state.battleflag` when any active NPC is within
  300 px of the hero, matching `RESEARCH.md §8.3` point 4 (on-screen =
  300×300 box around hero).
- **Scroll-text compliance**: `src/game/npc_ai.rs` and the AI wiring in
  `gameplay_scene.rs::update_actors` emit no player-facing strings —
  two-source rule (SPEC §23.6, REQ R-INTRO-012) is satisfied by
  construction.

### SPEC/REQ updates queued

- **F3.10 (SPEC-GAP)**: Add `extn.v3` (zone race filter) to the zone/
  extent model and use it in the `xtype > 59` FLEE gate.
- **F3.11 (SPEC-GAP)**: Formalise the `turtle_eggs` global counter as a
  world-state flag (not inventory) and thread it to `tick_npc`.
- **F3.12 (SPEC-GAP)**: Introduce STATE_SHOOT1/SHOOT3 FSM states and
  `fire_aimed_shot` dispatch to replace the `archer_cooldown` proxy.
- **F3.13 (SPEC-GAP)**: Carrier AI should run every 16 ticks
  (`daynight & 15 == 0`) with `set_course(mode=5)`; document in SPEC.
- **F3.14 (SPEC-GAP)**: Hook per-actor successful-action resets of
  `frustflag` from walk_step, shoot, melee, and dying paths per
  `frustration.md`.

### Blockers

None — all NEEDS-FIX and INVENTED items are resolved; SPEC-GAPs are queued
for later batch updates and/or subsystem audits (frustration, carrier-
transport, zones) and do not block other subsystem audits.

## Subsystem 4: encounters — ✅ Complete

**Reference**: `reference/logic/encounters.md` (primary) + `RESEARCH.md §2.7`,
`§9`, `game-loop.md` (no_motion_tick Phase 14h/14i/14j), `day-night.md` (no
night modifier — encounter cadence lives entirely in `no_motion_tick`),
`PROBLEMS.md`.
**Code**: `src/game/encounter.rs`, encounter call sites in
`src/game/gameplay_scene.rs` (`try_trigger_encounter`, `spawn_encounter_group`,
`SpawnEncounterRandom` / `SpawnEncounterType` debug handlers).
**Audit date**: 2025 (current session)

### Summary
- **11 findings**: 1 CONFORMANT, 3 NEEDS-FIX (all fixed), 2 INVENTED (both
  removed/replaced), 5 SPEC-GAP (queued), 0 REF-AMBIGUOUS, 0
  RESEARCH-REQUIRED.
- Fixes applied in **one commit** (SHA to be recorded by orchestrator).
- Build/tests: ✅ `cargo build` clean (zero new warnings); `cargo test` —
  579 + 12 + 12 tests passing (3 new targeted tests: weapon_probs groups 2
  and 3; carrier-blocks-trigger).

### Findings

#### F4.1 — `WEAPON_PROBS` groups 2 and 3 held wrong values [NEEDS-FIX]
**Location**: `src/game/encounter.rs::WEAPON_PROBS`.
**Reference**: `reference/logic/encounters.md#roll_weapon`
(`weapon_probs[arms*4+col]`, `fmain2.c:860-868`); `RESEARCH.md §2.7 →
weapon_probs`.
**Issue**: Rust had group 2 = `1,1,2,1` and group 3 = `2,1,2,2`. The
authoritative table (`fmain2.c:862-863`, RESEARCH §2.7) is group 2 =
`1,2,1,2` ("dirks and maces") and group 3 = `1,2,3,2` ("mostly maces, some
swords"). Group 2 is the Ogre's arms row (`encounter_chart[0].arms = 2`) so
ogres were rolling dirks 75 % of the time instead of dirks 50 % / maces
50 %. Group 3 is the Skeleton's row (`arms = 3`), which in the ref has a
1-in-4 chance of a sword — the Rust table made swords impossible for
skeletons.
**Resolution**: Replaced the two rows with the ref-exact values. Added
`test_weapon_probs_group2` and `test_weapon_probs_group3` locking the
corrected tuples.

#### F4.2 — `try_trigger_encounter` missing `active_carrier == 0` gate [NEEDS-FIX]
**Location**: `src/game/encounter.rs::try_trigger_encounter`;
`src/game/gameplay_scene.rs` encounter-tick block (≈5105).
**Reference**: `reference/logic/encounters.md#roll_wilderness_encounter`
(Phase 14j gate: "not actors_on_screen and not actors_loading and
active_carrier == 0 and xtype < 50"), `fmain.c:2081`, `RESEARCH.md §9.4`.
**Issue**: The ref suppresses random encounters while the hero is riding
any carrier (swan, raft, turtle, dragon). Rust only checked `xtype < 50`
and the 32-tick / screen / slot-count gates, so the hero could be
ambushed while on turtle-back or aboard a swan — impossible in the
original.
**Resolution**: Added an `active_carrier: i16` parameter to
`try_trigger_encounter`, gated on `active_carrier != 0 → None`. Threaded
`self.state.active_carrier` through from the gameplay-scene call site.
Added `test_try_trigger_encounter_blocks_on_carrier`.

#### F4.3 — Spawned enemies face south (4) instead of north (0) [NEEDS-FIX]
**Location**: `src/game/encounter.rs::spawn_encounter` (Npc init block).
**Reference**: `reference/logic/encounters.md#set_encounter`
(`an.facing = 0`, `fmain.c:2761`).
**Issue**: Rust hardcoded `facing: 4` ("south (toward hero, roughly)").
The ref initialises `facing = 0` (north); the actual heading is rewritten
the first time the AI layer calls `set_course` on the fresh actor. The
initial facing only matters for the first frame before AI ticks, but it
was visible on spawn — enemies appearing facing south regardless of
where the hero was. No ref citation supports facing the hero at spawn.
**Resolution**: Set `facing: 0` with a comment pointing back to
`fmain.c:2761` and noting set_course takes over on the first AI tick.

#### F4.4 — `gold: treasure * 5` seeded at spawn [INVENTED]
**Location**: `src/game/encounter.rs::spawn_encounter` (Npc init block).
**Reference**: `reference/logic/encounters.md#set_encounter` (no gold
field written) vs `#roll_treasure` (`fmain.c:3270-3273` — treasure drop
is a separate pickup-path concern rolled on body search, and resolves to
an `inv_list[]` slot index, not a currency amount).
**Issue**: Rust's `spawn_encounter` seeded `npc.gold = treasure_tier * 5`
so that the kill-reward path in `combat.rs:167` (`state.gold +=
npc.gold`) would hand out gold per-enemy-type. This is a double-invention:
(a) the ref never seeds `an->gold` at spawn, and (b) rolled treasure is
an item drop, not a pile-of-coins reward. Ogres therefore dropped 10
gold, orcs 5, wraiths 20, etc. — all fabricated amounts.
**Resolution**: Set `gold: 0` at spawn. The downstream currency reward
path still reads `npc.gold`, so non-encounter NPCs that legitimately
carry gold (e.g. shopkeepers, setfig cfile entries with baked gold
fields in their 16-byte record) are unaffected. Treasure-item drops
belong to the inventory/pickup audit.

#### F4.5 — `ENCOUNTER_CHART: [u8; 11]` dead zone→monster table [INVENTED]
**Location**: `src/game/encounter.rs` (top-of-file `pub const`).
**Reference**: None — the original `encounter_chart[]` (`fmain.c:42-64`)
is a monster-stats table keyed by race, not a zone-to-monster mapping.
The authoritative 11-entry stats table is already present as
`ENCOUNTER_CHART_FULL`.
**Issue**: A second 11-entry `ENCOUNTER_CHART` table mapped "forest →
Orc, plains → Orc, mountains → Skeleton, swamp → Ghost, dungeon →
Wraith, road → Orc, ruins → Skeleton, graveyard → Ghost, dark zone →
Wraith, beach → Orc, desert → Skeleton". No such table exists in the
original — zone-level monster selection is handled by `xtype` overrides
inside `roll_wilderness_encounter` (swamp, spider, xtype-49) plus the
extent-record `v3` filter for forced encounters. Also: several listed
zones (road, ruins, graveyard, beach, desert) do not correspond to any
`xtype` value the ref drives. The table was never referenced anywhere
in the codebase — pure dead invented data.
**Resolution**: Removed the constant. `rg` confirms no remaining
references.

#### F4.6 — Spawn count uses fixed `MAX_GROUP = 4`, not `v1 + rand(v2)` [SPEC-GAP]
**Location**: `src/game/encounter.rs::spawn_encounter_group` (const
`MAX_GROUP: usize = 4`).
**Reference**: `reference/logic/encounters.md#load_actors`
(`encounter_number = extn.v1 + rand(0, extn.v2 - 1)`, `fmain.c:2725`);
`RESEARCH.md §9.4 → Monster Count`.
**Issue**: The ref sets a *pending* `encounter_number` in 14j per the
current extent's `extn.v1`/`extn.v2` (world-at-large: 1 + rnd(8) → 1–8;
spider pit: 4; graveyard: 8 + rnd(8) → 8–15), and 14i drains that
counter into slots 3–6 across multiple 16-tick placement passes,
recycling dead slots. Rust telescopes 14i+14j into one call that spawns
exactly 4 enemies per trigger — so small-zone encounters (1–3 orcs
around the village) are oversized and large-zone encounters (8–15
skeletons at the graveyard) are undersized.
**Resolution**: Queued. Requires plumbing the active extent's `v1`/`v2`
into the spawn path plus a persistent `encounter_number` counter drained
on a 16-tick cadence. Cross-cuts subsystems 4, 11 (quests/zones), and 6
(extent model).

#### F4.7 — `mixflag` race-pairing + weapon-reroll logic missing [SPEC-GAP]
**Location**: `src/game/encounter.rs::spawn_encounter`,
`::spawn_encounter_group` (no `mixflag` global modelled).
**Reference**: `reference/logic/encounters.md#place_extent_encounters`
(`mixflag = rand(0, 0x7fffffff)` with zeroing for `xtype > 49` or
`(xtype & 3) == 0`); `#set_encounter` (bit 1 pairs races
`(encounter_type & 0xfffe) + rand(0,1)` except snakes; bit 2 re-rolls
the weapon column each spawn).
**Issue**: The ref's Phase 14i rolls `mixflag` once per placement batch.
Bit 1 enables race mixing (ogre↔orc, wraith↔skeleton); bit 2 enables
per-enemy weapon-column rerolls. Neither is modelled — Rust spawns a
single `encounter_type` with its own arms row and per-spawn weapon
rolls (equivalent to `mixflag & 4` always-on), so groups are always
racially homogeneous. Biome-uniform zones (`(xtype & 3) == 0`) are
supposed to force `mixflag = 0` to enforce uniformity; Rust already
spawns uniform groups, so this happens to match, but the bit-1 pairing
in non-uniform zones is missing.
**Resolution**: Queued. Requires a per-placement-batch `mixflag` and a
race-pairing branch inside `spawn_encounter`.

#### F4.8 — DKnight fixed spawn position (21635, 25762) not honoured [SPEC-GAP]
**Location**: `src/game/encounter.rs::spawn_encounter` (no race-filter
branch).
**Reference**: `reference/logic/encounters.md#set_encounter`
(`if extn.v3 == 7: xtest = 21635; ytest = 25762`, `fmain.c:2741`);
`RESEARCH.md §9.5` and the DKnight entry at §8.4.
**Issue**: The Dark Knight is unique in that its forced-encounter extent
pins its spawn to a fixed world coordinate, ignoring the ring/spread
logic. Combined with F3.4 (`stand_guard` out-of-reach) this is what keeps
the DKnight rooted at the hidden-valley exit. Rust scatters him inside
the usual 63-pixel box around the `encounter_origin`. The observable
effect depends on the caller — the `SpawnEncounterRandom` debug action
never enters the hidden-valley extent, so random-tick spawning can't
reproduce this; the breakage would show when the forced-encounter
`find_place` path is ported and routed through the same
`spawn_encounter`.
**Resolution**: Queued. Requires `extn.v3` plumbing (same SPEC-GAP as
F3.10 ai-system). When present, `spawn_encounter` should short-circuit
to (21635, 25762) for race 7.

#### F4.9 — Astral-plane terrain-code-7 acceptance missing [SPEC-GAP]
**Location**: `src/game/encounter.rs::spawn_encounter_group` (collision
retry loop).
**Reference**: `reference/logic/encounters.md#set_encounter`
(`if xtype == 52 and px_to_im(xtest, ytest) == 7: placed = True`,
`fmain.c:2746`).
**Issue**: On the astral plane (xtype 52) the ref accepts the "void"
terrain code 7 as a valid spawn target so Loraii can place against an
otherwise unwalkable backdrop. Rust uses only `actor_collides` for the
retry check and has no xtype-52 / terrain-7 acceptance branch. Astral
Loraii spawns will therefore reject every slot and fall through to the
"no placement" exit more often than the original.
**Resolution**: Queued. Requires `px_to_im` call at the retry-loop call
site plus an `xtype == 52` branch.

#### F4.10 — Cluster-origin retry (9 attempts + walkability) not implemented [SPEC-GAP]
**Location**: `src/game/encounter.rs::spawn_encounter_group`
(`encounter_origin` is called once).
**Reference**: `reference/logic/encounters.md#place_extent_encounters`
(k-loop 1..10: call `set_loc`, bail out of the whole batch if none of 9
candidate cluster origins lands on terrain code 0).
**Issue**: The ref tries up to 9 random ring-origins around the hero
and only fills slots when one of them passes `px_to_im == 0`. If all 9
fail (player stuck in a walkable pocket surrounded by water/rock) the
batch is dropped, and `encounter_number` carries to the next 16-tick
pass. Rust picks a single ring-origin with no walkability check and
relies on the per-slot `actor_collides` retry; this changes the spawn-
suppression behaviour around cliff edges, shorelines, and narrow
passages — enemies can appear where the original would have skipped
the batch.
**Resolution**: Queued. Requires an outer origin-retry loop in
`spawn_encounter_group` plus `px_to_im(enc_x, enc_y) == 0` on each
candidate.

#### F4.11 — `actors_loading` gate omitted (architectural) [SPEC-GAP]
**Location**: `src/game/encounter.rs::try_trigger_encounter`.
**Reference**: `reference/logic/encounters.md#roll_wilderness_encounter`
and `#prep` (async disk I/O model; 14h polls `CheckDiskIO(8)` and 14j is
suppressed while `actors_loading == True`).
**Issue**: The port loads sprite assets synchronously at startup, so
there is no concept of "actors still streaming in from disk" to gate
against. The ref's `actors_loading` gate therefore has no analog. This is
an architectural divergence (SPEC §3 async-I/O replacement), not a
fidelity bug in practice, but it bears noting because the ref lists it
as part of the 14j gate tuple.
**Resolution**: Queued as SPEC documentation (SPEC §19.3 / §3 note that
async-I/O gates collapse to always-ready).

### CONFORMANT items

- **C4.1 — `pick_encounter_type` xtype overrides**: Swamp (`xtype == 7`
  rerolls 2→4), spider region (`xtype == 8 → 6`), and `xtype == 49 →
  wraith (2)` match `encounters.md#roll_wilderness_encounter` lines
  2087–2090 exactly.
- **C4.2 — Danger-level formula**: `region_num > 7 → 5+xtype` /
  else `2+xtype`, gated by `rand(0,63) > danger_level → skip`, matches
  `encounters.md` lines 2082–2085 verbatim. Spawn probability
  `(danger_level+1)/64` is preserved.
- **C4.3 — Ring-distance formula**: `encounter_origin` uses the 8-way
  direction table × (150 + rand(0, 63)) / 2 per `set_loc`
  (`fmain2.c:1716-1719`). Actual pixel offsets fall inside the
  ref's 150–213 px envelope.
- **C4.4 — Goal selection by weapon bit 4**: `weapon & 4 != 0` routes
  to ARCHER1/ARCHER2 (plus cleverness offset); else ATTACK1/ATTACK2 —
  matches `encounters.md` lines 2762–2764.
- **C4.5 — Scroll-text compliance**: encounter spawning emits no
  player-facing strings; the two-source rule (SPEC §23.6,
  R-INTRO-012) is satisfied by construction.
- **C4.6 — `freeze_timer` suppression**: gameplay-scene gate
  (`freeze_timer == 0`) before calling `try_trigger_encounter` matches
  `RESEARCH.md` freeze-timer semantics (encounters suppressed while
  freeze > 0).

### SPEC/REQ updates queued

- **F4.6 (SPEC-GAP)**: Model `encounter_number` as a persistent counter
  drained on a 16-tick cadence into slots 3–6; source from the active
  extent's `extn.v1 + rand(0, extn.v2 - 1)`.
- **F4.7 (SPEC-GAP)**: Add a per-placement-batch `mixflag` and wire
  `mixflag & 2` (race pairing) / `mixflag & 4` (weapon-col reroll) into
  `spawn_encounter`.
- **F4.8 (SPEC-GAP)**: Once `extn.v3` is plumbed (see F3.10),
  short-circuit `spawn_encounter` for `extn.v3 == 7` to (21635, 25762).
- **F4.9 (SPEC-GAP)**: Accept terrain code 7 as a valid spawn surface
  when `xtype == 52` (astral plane).
- **F4.10 (SPEC-GAP)**: Add an outer 9-try origin retry around
  `spawn_encounter_group` with `px_to_im == 0` walkability gating.
- **F4.11 (SPEC-GAP, doc-only)**: Note in SPEC that the async-I/O
  `actors_loading` gate collapses to always-false in the port.

### Blockers

None — all NEEDS-FIX and INVENTED items are resolved; SPEC-GAPs are
queued for later batch updates (extent-model / zones / carrier-transport
audits) and do not block other subsystem audits.
