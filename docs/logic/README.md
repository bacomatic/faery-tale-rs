# Logic Documentation — Index

This directory contains strict, linter-backed pseudo-code specifications for every non-trivial branching function in *The Faery Tale Adventure*. Combined with [ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md), [RESEARCH.md](../RESEARCH.md), [STORYLINE.md](../STORYLINE.md), and the spatial/quest JSON databases, these docs are sufficient to reproduce the game's behavior without reading the 1987 source.

**Fidelity target:** behavioral. Same inputs produce the same observable gameplay. Implementation primitives (RNG algorithm, integer widths when not observable, fixed-point layout) are left to the porter. See the [design spec](../superpowers/specs/2026-04-20-logic-docs-design.md) for the full rationale.

**Normative references:**
- [STYLE.md](STYLE.md) — pseudo-code grammar.
- [SYMBOLS.md](SYMBOLS.md) — global symbol registry.

**Lint:**
```bash
tools/run.sh lint_logic.py
```

## Reading Order (for porters)

1. [STYLE.md](STYLE.md) — learn the grammar.
2. [SYMBOLS.md](SYMBOLS.md) — skim the registry.
3. `game-loop.md` *(Wave 2)* — the canonical per-frame sequence.
4. Subsystem docs in order of gameplay centrality (Wave 3+): combat → movement → encounters → quests → npc-dialogue → save-load → shops → brother-succession → visual-effects.

## Function Index

Every documented function appears here with a link to its canonical definition. The linter verifies completeness in both directions.

| Function | File | Purpose |
|---|---|---|

*(Rows are appended as new logic docs are authored. Orphan entries and orphan function definitions both fail `lint_logic.py`.)*
