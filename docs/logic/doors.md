# Doors — Logic Spec

> Fidelity: behavioral  |  Source files: fmain.c
> Cross-refs: [RESEARCH §6](../RESEARCH.md#6-doors), [game-loop.md#check_door](game-loop.md#check_door), [menu-system.md#option_handler](menu-system.md#option_handler), [movement.md#walk_step](movement.md#walk_step), [_discovery/doors.md](../_discovery/doors.md)

## Overview

This spec covers the three low-level primitives that implement door and region transitions. The high-level per-frame straddle check that drives indoor↔outdoor swaps lives in [`check_door`](game-loop.md#check_door); the inline collision path that opens a freestanding door the hero walks into lives in [`walk_step`](movement.md#walk_step) at `fmain.c:1607`. This file documents what those sites call into:

- [`xfer`](#xfer) — the generic teleport primitive. Updates `hero_*`, `map_*`, optionally re-derives `new_region` from world coordinates, re-kicks disk loads via `load_all`, regenerates the minimap, forces a redraw, swaps music, and nudges the player out of any wall they landed in. Called by `check_door` (both directions), the quicksand→dungeon drop at `fmain.c:1788`, the princess rescue, brother-succession revive, save-load post-fixup, and the desert-gate zone handler.
- [`doorfind`](#doorfind) — given pixel `(x, y)` near a tile with terrain code `TERRAIN_DOOR=15`, walk to the door's upper-left tile, look up its `(door_id, map_id)` pair in `TABLE:open_list`, and — if the key type matches — rewrite 1–4 live `sector_mem` tiles to the "open" graphic and print "It opened." Otherwise prints "It's locked." on the first bump. Called inline from `walk_step` with `keytype=0` (bump-to-open on unlocked wood doors) and from [`use_key_on_door`](#use_key_on_door) with `keytype=1..6` (deliberate key use).
- [`use_key_on_door`](#use_key_on_door) — the `CMODE_KEYS` case body inside `do_option` (`fmain.c:3472-3488`). Sweeps the 9 directions around the hero at 16 px range, invokes `doorfind` with the selected key code, and on success decrements the key count in `stuff[KEYBASE+k]`.

`doorlist[]` (the 86-entry outdoor↔indoor coordinate table), its type constants (`HWOOD`, `VWOOD`, `HSTONE`, `CAVE`/`VLOG`, `DESERT`, `STAIR`, …), and the outdoor-binary-search / indoor-linear-scan traversal algorithm are normatively specified by [`check_door`](game-loop.md#check_door) and are not repeated here. `TABLE:doorlist`, `TABLE:open_list`, and the full type-to-value map are enumerated in `_discovery/doors.md`.

## Symbols

All numeric literals in the pseudo blocks below carry inline `# fmain.c:LINE — meaning` annotations rather than being promoted to named constants in SYMBOLS.md. Proposed SYMBOLS.md additions (see final report) are listed below; each is referenced via the `Calls:` line of every function that uses it until they are registered.

Proposed additions (not yet registered):

- `KEYBASE = 16` — `fmain.c:427` — `stuff[]` slot of the first (Gold) key. Keys live at `stuff[KEYBASE+0..5]`.
- `NOKEY = 0` — `fmain.c:1047` — `open_list.keytype` sentinel for doors that open on bump.
- `GOLD = 1`, `GREEN = 2`, `KBLUE = 3`, `RED = 4`, `GREY = 5`, `WHITE = 6` — `fmain.c:1047` — `enum ky` key codes; `doorfind(…, keytype)` matches `open_list[j].keytype` against these.
- `TABLE:doorlist` — `fmain.c:240-325` — 86-entry `struct door[]` for outdoor↔indoor transitions; sorted by `xc1`. Fields: `xc1, yc1, xc2, yc2, type, secs`.
- `TABLE:open_list` — `fmain.c:1059-1078` — 17-entry `struct door_open[]` for tile-level unlock: `{door_id, map_id, new1, new2, above, keytype}`.
- `hero_x: u16`, `hero_y: u16` — `fmain.c` — player world coordinates (aliases for `anim_list[0].abs_x/abs_y`).
- `map_x: i32`, `map_y: i32` — `fmain.c` — scroll origin of the playfield camera in world coordinates.
- `current_loads` — `fmain.c` — `struct file_index` mirror of the currently loaded region; `current_loads.image[i]` gives the image-block id used for tile ids with `sec_id>>6 == i`.
- `bumped: i8` — `fmain.c:1046` — one-frame latch that suppresses repeated "It's locked." messages.
- `encounter_number: i32` — `fmain.c` — pending-encounter counter; cleared to zero by `xfer`.

Globals already in [SYMBOLS.md](SYMBOLS.md) used here: `anim_list`, `stuff`, `viewstatus`, `keydir`, `region_num` (read via `check_door`), `VIEWSTATUS_CORRUPT`, `TERRAIN_DOOR`.

## Notes

- **No `enter_door` / `exit_door` functions exist in the source.** The outdoor→indoor and indoor→outdoor halves are two branches of a single `if (region_num < 8) … else …` inside the main loop. Both halves are traced in [`check_door`](game-loop.md#check_door). The orientation-precision rules (`hero_y & 0x10` for horizontal doors, `hero_x & 15` for vertical), the `CAVE`/horizontal/vertical destination offsets, the `DESERT`→5-statue gate, the `riding` short-circuit, and the asymmetric fade (enter fades, exit is instant) are all specified there.
- **`TERRAIN_DOOR` inline handler.** The one-line collision trigger at `fmain.c:1607` — `if (i==0 && j==15) doorfind(xtest,ytest,0);` — is part of [`walk_step`](movement.md#walk_step). It fires `doorfind` with `keytype=0` whenever the hero's proposed next tile has terrain class 15, giving the "bump to open unlocked wood doors" behaviour. `bumped` is cleared on the next step where `j != 15`.
- **Quicksand→dungeon drop** at `fmain.c:1784-1790` uses `xfer(0x1080, 34950, False)` with an explicit `new_region = 9` and is not door-mediated. It lives in `walk_step`'s `STATE_SINK` path.
- **`STAIR` type (value 15) is horizontal.** `STAIR & 1 == 1`, so the stargate pair at `doorlist[14..15]` (`fmain.c:254-255`) uses the horizontal `(xc2+16, yc2)` / `(xc1+16, yc1+34)` offsets, not a dedicated stair codepath.
- **Opened-door state is not saved.** `doorfind` writes directly into `sector_mem` via `mapxy`; these edits live for the lifetime of the currently loaded sector. Any `xfer` that triggers a region reload discards them (see `load_all` inside `xfer`). No entry in the save record (see [save-load.md](save-load.md)) tracks per-door open state.
