Installing Faery Tale Adventure on a harddrive:

1) Create a drawer on your harddrive. (For example purposes I will assume
that this drawer was named "Work:FTA".)

2) Insert your original Faery Tale Adventure disk into DF0:

3) From the CLI run the script "Install-FTA" with the name of the drawer
from step 1. For example:

    Install-FTA Work:FTA

4) The script will say when it is done.
