## Overview

The placard system consists of two independent primitives that work together. `placard_text(N)` renders a pre-composed, multi-line narrative message onto the full-screen RastPort established by `map_message`: it looks up slot N in the `mst` dispatch table (`narr.asm:237`) and delegates to `ssp`, which walks an encoded byte string calling `Move` for XY positioning escapes (byte `0x80` followed by x/2 and y bytes) and `Text` for literal character runs. Callers interleave `placard_text()` calls with `name()` — which prints the current hero's name at the current pen position via `print_cont` — to splice the hero's name into the narrative mid-sentence. Each `placard_text` call inherits the pen position from whatever call preceded it, so multi-part messages (e.g. the princess-rescue sequence) chain seamlessly.

`placard()` is separate: it draws the animated Greek-key (meander) decorative border that frames the text. It is a pure 68000 assembly routine (`fsubs.asm:387`) that issues Amiga `SetAPen`/`Move`/`Draw` calls directly to `rp_map`, the RastPort whose BitMap pointer was redirected by `map_message` to the currently-displayed playfield page. There is no double-buffer flip between any two `Draw` calls, so every stroke is immediately visible on screen. Each line segment is drawn **five times** in a tight k-loop: four passes in color 1 (white) followed by one pass in color 24 (brown-red). This produces the observable "trace white → settle red" flash for each stroke as the pattern extends along the frame — no `Delay` is needed. The completed border is drawn entirely in brown-red. Four line pairs fill all four sides of the frame simultaneously from a single advancing polyline origin: pairs A and B are 180°-symmetric about the pixel coordinate (142, 62) and fill the left and right edges; pairs C and D are a 90° axis swap of A and B (also 180°-symmetric about (142, 62)) and fill the top and bottom edges.

Related effects: `map_message` and `message_off` (which put the screen into and out of full-screen placard mode) are documented in [visual-effects.md#map_message](visual-effects.md#map_message). The death and victory calling sequences that drive these functions are in [brother-succession.md#revive](brother-succession.md#revive) and [quests.md#end_game_sequence](quests.md#end_game_sequence). The copy-protection question caller (`fmain.c:1235`) also uses `placard_text(19)` to display the quiz lead-in.

## Symbols

Constants local to this subsystem (not in SYMBOLS.md):

- `XY: u8 = 128` — `narr.asm:230` — position-escape byte in encoded message strings.
- `ETX: u8 = 0` — `narr.asm:231` — string terminator (same value as ASCII NUL).

Tables and globals required in SYMBOLS.md (see proposed additions at end of this file):

- `mst` — `narr.asm:237` — 20-entry pc-relative offset table; each entry resolves a `placard_text(N)` index to one of the `msg*` byte strings below.
- `xmod` — `fsubs.asm:384` — 16-entry signed x-delta table used by `placard()`.
- `ymod` — `fsubs.asm:385` — 16-entry signed y-delta table used by `placard()`.
- `rp_map` — `fsubs.asm:380` — full-screen RastPort; its BitMap is redirected to the live playfield bitmap by `map_message` before any placard routine is called.

Globals already in [SYMBOLS.md](SYMBOLS.md) used here: `rp`.

## ssp

Source: `fsubs.asm:497-530`
Called by: `placard_text` (tail-call), `print_cont`
Calls: `Move`, `Text`, `rp`

The encoding format used by all `msg*` strings:
- A byte equal to `XY` (128) introduces a position command: the next byte is `x/2` (x coordinate stored halved to fit in one unsigned byte; doubled on read), the byte after is `y`. The cursor is moved to `(x, y)` without printing.
- Any run of bytes with values 1–127 is a literal text run; the run ends at the first byte that is 0 (ETX) or ≥ 128 (another XY or ETX variant).
- A byte equal to 0 (ETX) terminates the entire message.

After a text run ends, the terminating byte (XY or ETX) is re-read on the next loop iteration, so XY and ETX act as both run terminators and control codes.

```pseudo
def ssp(msg: bytes) -> None:
    """Walk an XY-positioned encoded byte string, issuing Move for XY escapes and Text for runs."""
    XY = 128                                             # narr.asm:230 — position-escape byte

## placard_text

Source: `narr.asm:235-248`
Called by: `revive` (`fmain.c:2862-2868`), `rescue` (`fmain2.c:1588-1591`), `win_colors` (`fmain2.c:1607`), `copy_protect_junk` setup (`fmain.c:1235`)

### Message table

This is the authoritative list of all 20 placard messages. Each row shows the exact `(x, y)` pen-move escapes and literal text fragments a port must emit, in order. All coordinates are in the 320×200 display-pixel space of `rp_map`. Messages whose content is just an XY position command followed immediately by ETX (shown as "*(position only)*") move the pen without printing any text; the caller then invokes `name()` to print the hero's name at that position before the next `placard_text` appends more text at the current pen.

**X-coordinate rounding.** In the source, each XY x-byte is written as the expression `x/2`, evaluated at assembly time using 68000 assembler integer division. `ssp` multiplies the stored byte by 2 on read (`fsubs.asm:536`), so any **odd** x in the source collapses to `x−1` at render time. The author-intended coordinates and the actually-rendered coordinates therefore differ on five messages:

| Source expression | Stored byte | Rendered x | Affects |
|-------------------|-------------|------------|---------|
| `21/2` | 10 | **20** | msg8, msg8a, msg8b, msg9, msg9a, msg9b, msg10, msg10a, msg10b |
| `25/2` | 12 | **24** | msg6 line 2 |
| `35/2` | 17 | **34** | msg11 lines 2–5, msg11a |
| `71/2` | 35 | **70** | msg11 line 1 |
| `x/2` (even x) | x/2 | x | all other lines (no rounding) |

The table below lists the **rendered** `(x, y)` — the values a port must pass to its equivalent of `Move()`.

| N  | Asm label | Context | `(x, y)` sequence → text fragment (`name()` splice inserted by caller) |

You would` · `(10, 85)` `aid them and give directions? Answer,` · `(10, 95)` `then, these three questions and prove` · `(10, 105)` `your fitness to be their advisor:` |

Messages `msg7`, `msg8a`, `msg9a`, `msg10a`, and `msg11` end with `", ",ETX` (literal text followed by ETX, no final XY). The next `placard_text` or `name()` call therefore resumes drawing at the pen position left by the preceding `Text()` call — the trailing text is **not** positioned by a subsequent XY. Similarly, `msg8b`, `msg9b`, `msg10b`, and `msg11a` open with a literal text fragment (`" knew that"`, `knew that his quest` [positioned by its own XY, unlike 8b/10b], `" knew "`, `" once more set"`) that is drawn at the pen position inherited from the preceding `name()`.

### Deliberate deviation from source: the msg8a typo

> **Warning to future agents:** the rendered text for `msg8a` in the table above **intentionally omits a stray comma** that is present in the original source. **Do not "fix" the table by re-adding it.** See details below.

`narr.asm:307` contains the byte sequence `"their love for each, "` — an extra comma after `each` that does not appear in the parallel msg9a (`"for each other, "`, `narr.asm:317`) or msg10a (`"each other, "`, `narr.asm:326`). Rendered in sequence with the following line (`narr.asm:308`, `"other, "`), the source bytes would display as:

```
their love for each, other,
```

This is a typo in the 1987 source: the author's intent, consistent with the two parallel princess messages, was `their love for each other,`. Because `placard.md` is a **logic spec describing author intent** (not a byte-for-byte dump of `narr.asm`), the rendered-text column above shows the intended text (`for each ` / `other,`) with the stray comma removed.

- **Do not edit `narr.asm`** — source files are read-only in this repository. The typo remains in the source bytes.
- **Do not re-add the stray comma to this spec** — the deviation is deliberate and matches author intent.
- **Ports that want pixel-accurate fidelity** to the original Amiga display must still reproduce the typo on-screen; ports that prefer author intent can drop it. This spec's table shows the author-intent form.

### Multi-part rescue sequences

`placard_text` for princess-rescue cutscenes uses `princess * 3` as an index offset into the message table to select the right princess (0 = Katra, 1 = Karla, 2 = Kandy). The calling pattern is always:

```text
placard_text(8 + princess*3)   → positions pen (XY+ETX only)
name()                          → prints hero name at that position
placard_text(9 + princess*3)   → prints rescue body text
name()                          → prints hero name again mid-sentence
placard_text(10 + princess*3)  → prints closing clause
placard()                       → draws the border
```

Between the two `placard_text` calls in the successor-brother sequence (`fmain.c:2875`), callers issue `SetAPen(rp, 0); RectFill(rp, 13, 13, 271, 107)` to erase the inner text rectangle (coordinates 13–271 × 13–107) before rendering the next card.

### Placard calling sequences

The placard messages are sequenced by callers in `fmain2.c:1586–1607` and `fmain.c:1235, 2862–2877`:

**Copy protection** (`fmain.c:1235`):
- `placard_text(19)` → copy-protection lead-in, then three `question(j)` calls.

**Brother succession** (`fmain2.c:1588`, princess-rescue cutscene for departing brother):
- Let `i = (brother - 2) * 3` (0 for Phillip, 3 for Kevin) — but note the callsite in `fmain2.c:1588` actually indexes by `princess` field (0=Katra, 1=Karla, 2=Kandy). See `rescue` pseudo in fmain2.c.
- `placard_text(8+i)`, `name()`, `placard_text(9+i)`, `name()`, `placard_text(10+i)`.

**King–princess cutscene** (`fmain2.c:1591`):
- `placard_text(17)`, `name()`, `placard_text(18)` — quest resumption.

**Brother-intro / death sequence** (`fmain.c:2862–2877`):

Each brother's gameplay is bookended by a start placard and a death placard.
Both placards for a *transition* are shown in the single `revive(True)` call
that fires when the **preceding** brother dies — so the death card of the
outgoing brother and the start card of the incoming brother appear back-to-back
inside the same call, before the new brother ever takes control.

| Brother | Start placard | … plays … | Death placard | Where shown |
|---------|---------------|------------|---------------|-------------|
| Julian  | `placard_text(0)` msg1 — "Rescue the Talisman!" intro | Julian plays | `placard_text(1)` msg2 — "his luck had run out" | Death card shown at start of Phillip's `revive` call |
| Phillip | `placard_text(2)` msg3 — "So Phillip set out" | Phillip plays | `placard_text(3)` msg4 — "Phillip's cleverness could not save him" | Death card shown at start of Kevin's `revive` call |
| Kevin   | `placard_text(4)` msg5 — "So Kevin took up the quest" | Kevin plays | `placard_text(5)` msg6 — "And so ends our sad tale" (game over) | Death card shown in game-over branch of Kevin's `revive` |

Within each `revive(True)` call the pair is rendered as:
1. First card (death of outgoing brother **or** intro for Julian): `placard_text(N)` → `placard()` → `Delay(120)`.
2. Gap + clear inner rectangle: `Delay(80)` → `RectFill` → `Delay(10)` (skipped for Julian and game-over).
3. Second card (start of incoming brother): `placard_text(N+1)` → `Delay(120)` (skipped for Julian and game-over).

**Win sequence / game-over** (`fmain2.c:1607`):
- `placard_text(6)`, `name()`, `placard_text(7)`, `placard()` — victory ending.

### Source-level typo note: msg7 "villanous"

`msg7` at `narr.asm:294` spells the word "villanous" (one `l`). This is a separate source-level typo that this spec preserves verbatim in the rendered text (unlike the msg8a comma, "villanous" is the word the author typed and there is no parallel message suggesting a different intent). Do not "correct" it to "villainous" in this spec or in ports that aim for author intent.

## placard

Source: `fsubs.asm:387-475`
Called by: `revive` (`fmain.c:2870`), `rescue` (`fmain2.c:1589`), `win_colors` (`fmain2.c:1607`)
Calls: `SetAPen`, `Move`, `Draw`, `TABLE:xmod`, `TABLE:ymod`, `rp_map`

Draws an animated Greek-key (meander) decorative border directly onto the live display via `rp_map`. The routine executes three nested loops. The outermost iterates `i` from 16 down through 0 (17 passes). For each pass, the middle loop iterates `j_idx` through all 16 entries of the `xmod`/`ymod` delta tables, computing the next endpoint `(dx, dy) = (xorg + xmod[j_idx], yorg + ymod[j_idx])`. After each j-step the origin is advanced: `(xorg, yorg) = (dx, dy)`, chaining the steps into a continuous polyline. After one complete 16-step j-pass the net delta is `(0, +16)`: `xorg` returns to its starting value each time and `yorg` advances by 16 pixels. One j-pass traces one repeat unit of the meander motif; 17 outer iterations lay down 17 repeat units along the long axis.

The innermost k-loop draws each segment **five times**: k = 4, 3, 2, 1 all set color 1 (white); k = 0 sets color 24 (brown-red). Because `rp_map` shares the currently-displayed bitmap — no double-buffer flip occurs inside this function — every individual `Draw` call is immediately visible on screen. The result is a visible white flash on each stroke that resolves to brown-red as each meander unit is laid down. The first `k=4` pass (white) and the final `k=0` pass (brown-red) of each stroke are both observable.

Four line pairs are drawn per k-iteration. Pairs **A** and **B** are 180° rotations of each other about center (142, 62); pairs **C** and **D** are likewise 180° symmetric about the same center. C and D are a 90° axis swap of A/B, so A/B tile vertically down the left/right edges of the frame while C/D tile horizontally along the top/bottom edges. All four sides are therefore drawn simultaneously on every stroke. Pairs A and B are suppressed when `i ≤ 9`: the left/right edges are only ~112 pixels tall and only need 7 meander units (i = 16–10) to fill, while the top/bottom edges are wider and continue to accumulate units through all 17 iterations via pairs C/D.

| Pair | Move to | Draw to | Condition |
|------|---------|---------|-----------|
| A | `(xorg, yorg)` | `(dx, dy)` | `i > 9` only |
| B | `(284 − xorg, 124 − yorg)` | `(284 − dx, 124 − dy)` | `i > 9` only |
| C | `(16 + yorg, 12 − xorg)` | `(16 + dy, 12 − dx)` | always |
| D | `(268 − yorg, 112 + xorg)` | `(268 − dy, 112 + dx)` | always |

The coordinate constants 284 and 124 define the width and height of the border rectangle; 268 and 112 are their complements minus the 16/12-pixel axis-swap offsets. The inner text rectangle cleared by callers (`RectFill(rp, 13, 13, 271, 107)`) sits entirely inside this frame. The `xmod`/`ymod` delta tables (`fsubs.asm:384-385`) each have 16 entries of ±4 or 0:

## Notes

### Border motif — ASCII art

The motif is the classic Greek key (meander): each j-pass lays down one rectangular-spiral hook that interlocks with the next. Each grid cell below represents one 4×4-pixel unit (the step size of `xmod`/`ymod`). Box-drawing characters show the polyline drawn by one complete 16-step j-pass. Pair A/B tiles **vertically** along the left/right edges; pair C/D tiles **horizontally** along the top/bottom edges.

**Vertical tile** — pair A, left edge (pair B is the 180° rotation on the right edge). One hook occupies a 13 px wide × 16 px tall region (cols 0–3, rows 0–4 where row 4 is the top of the next tile). The j-pass starts at (col 3, row 0), traces leftward across the top (row 0, cols 3→0), down the outer edge (col 0, rows 0→3), partway along row 3 (cols 0→2), then curls inward — up col 2, left along row 2, up col 1, right along row 1 all the way to col 3 — and continues down col 3 past the tile into row 4 of the next. Two consecutive hooks shown:

```
col→    0     1     2     3
row 0   ┌─────────────────┐       ← tile 1 top (row 0, full width)
        │                         ← col 0 (outer) descends
row 1   │     ┌───────────┐       ← inner curl top; col 3 (inner) begins
        │     │           │
row 2   │     └─────┐     │       ← inner fold
        │           │     │
row 3   └───────────┘     │       ← tile 1 row 3 (partial, cols 0→2)
                          │       ← notch at col 0 between tiles
row 4   ┌─────────────────┘       ← tile 2 top joins tile 1 col 3 seamlessly
        │                 
row 5   │     ┌───────────┐
        │     │           │
row 6   │     └─────┐     │
        │           │     │
row 7   └───────────┘     │
                          ⋮
```

Column 0 is the **outer** edge of the border (closest to the screen edge); column 3 is the **inner** edge (closest to the text). Col 3 joins seamlessly across the tile boundary — each hook exits at (col 3, row 4) exactly where the next hook's top line begins. The outer edge (col 0) has a 4 px notch between consecutive hooks (rows 3→4) because each hook's row-3 horizontal stops at col 2. Pair B draws the same motif rotated 180° about (142, 62), placing mirror-image hooks on the right edge of the border with their inner column facing the text.

**Horizontal tile** — pair C, top edge (pair D is the 180° rotation on the bottom edge). Pair C is the 90° axis swap of pair A, so the same motif lies on its side: each hook is 16 px wide × 13 px tall with its inner edge on top (toward the text) and outer edge on the bottom (toward the screen edge). Two consecutive hooks shown side by side (cols 0–4 = hook 1, cols 4–8 = hook 2):

```
col→     0     1     2     3     4     5     6     7     8
row 0    │     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
         │     │                 │     │                 │
row 1    │     │     ┌─────┐     │     │     ┌─────┐     │
         │     │     │     │     │     │     │     │     │
row 2    │     └─────┘     │     │     └─────┘     │     │
         │                 │     │                 │     │
row 3    └─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘     ⋯
         └──── hook 1 ────┘      └──── hook 2 ────┘
```

Row 3 is the **outer** edge (screen-side); row 0 is the **inner** edge (text-side, where col 0 of each hook continues as col 4 of the previous hook). The outer edge has a 4 px notch between hooks (row 3, col 3→4) because each hook's row-3 horizontal ends at its own col 3 before the next hook's col 4 continues the bottom. Pair D places the same motif rotated 180°, producing hooks along the bottom edge with their inner edge on top.

The four edges of the complete border are drawn independently by pairs A–D — the pair-A/B vertical hooks and the pair-C/D horizontal hooks are not specifically joined at the corners, so each corner of the border has a small notch between the last vertical hook and the last horizontal hook.

### Proposed SYMBOLS.md additions

These globals are required for the pseudo-code above to resolve under `check_symbol_resolution` and should be appended to SYMBOLS.md §3 (Global variables):

```text
mst: list                           # narr.asm:237 — TABLE:mst; 20-entry placard message dispatch table
xmod: list                          # fsubs.asm:384 — TABLE:xmod; 16-entry x-delta table for placard() spiral
ymod: list                          # fsubs.asm:385 — TABLE:ymod; 16-entry y-delta table for placard() spiral
rp_map: object                      # fsubs.asm:380 — full-screen placard RastPort (BitMap redirected by map_message)
```

And to SYMBOLS.md §4 (Table registry):

| `TABLE:mst`  | `narr.asm:237` | 20-entry pc-relative placard message offset table |
| `TABLE:xmod` | `fsubs.asm:384` | 16-entry signed x-delta table: `[-4,-4,-4,0,0,0,4,4,0,-4,0,4,4,0,0,0]` |
| `TABLE:ymod` | `fsubs.asm:385` | 16-entry signed y-delta table: `[0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,-4,0,-4,0,0,4,4,4]` |
